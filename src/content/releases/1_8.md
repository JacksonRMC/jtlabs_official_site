![Vinyl Release Party](../../assets/vinyl.webp)

Vinyl Finance, home to the grooviest algorithmic token fork pegged to $FTM on the Fantom Opera network and first of its kind Vinyl tNFT Marketplace

[Vinyl Documentation](https://vinyl-finance.github.io/vinylfinance-docs/docs/welcome)

- **Inspiration** Inspired by the original idea behind Basis (and it's predecessors bDollar and soup), our team set out to build upon the success of tomb.finance and subsequent 2omb.finance with the creation of Vinyl.

- **Tokenomics:** Vinyl Finance is a multi-token protocol pegged to Fantom that consists of the following three tokens:

  -Vinyl (**$VINYL**)

  -Tracks, aka Vinyl Shares (**$TRACKS**)

  -CD, Vinyl Bonds (**$CD**).

- **The Future:** Stage 2 of Vinyl Finance is tNFT (tangible NFT) marketplace where VINYL is the native token to allow for the purchase of underground house music wax and shipment worldwide
